# t-SNE Toy Example

This is a toy example using t-SNE for the group meeting journal club!  
This would be a highly simplified version of how t-SNE is done for Single Cell RNA-sequence data.   
The dataset used in this example came from Pollen article. The article can be found here [https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2967].
